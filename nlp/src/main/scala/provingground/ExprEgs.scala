/**
  * Examples to experiment and illustrate expression level NLP parsing
  * Issues revealed:
  *  - Cardinals should be treated as determiners
  *  - determiners in a phrase e.g. 'divides some ...' need special rules
  *  - useless 'then'
  *  - primes is tagged as a verb, not a noun
  *  - in 'are represented by ...', 'represented by ...'
  *  - copula followed by an adjectival phrase is mishandled
  *  - TeX fragment that is part of a word gives error.
